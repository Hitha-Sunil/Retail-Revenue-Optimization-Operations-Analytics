# Retail-Revenue-Optimization-Operations-Analytics
# End-to-End Retail Analytics Flagship Project
# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on end-to-end retail analytics, covering sales performance, inventory risk, and operational efficiency using a simulated real-world retail dataset.

The goal is to help retail decision-makers:

Optimize revenue across stores and products

Identify inventory stock risks

Monitor operational delays

Enable data-driven decisions through dashboards

# 🎯 Business Objectives

Analyze revenue trends across products, categories, and stores

Identify top-performing and underperforming products

Detect inventory stock risks based on reorder levels

Measure operational efficiency and delivery delays

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholders

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Faker

SQL: SQLite (via Python)

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX, dashboarding

Jupyter Notebook: EDA & analytics

Anaconda Environment

# 📂 Dataset Description

A synthetic retail dataset was generated to mimic real business scenarios.

# Tables Included:

Products – Product IDs and categories

Sales – Daily transactions across stores

Inventory – Stock levels, reorder thresholds, suppliers

Operations – Order processing, delivery duration, delay status

This approach ensures realistic, scalable, and interview-safe data.

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed using Python (Pandas):

Revenue calculations (Units_Sold × Unit_Price)

Product & category-wise sales analysis

Store-level performance evaluation

Inventory stock vs reorder analysis

Operational delay identification

# 🗄️ SQL Analytics

DataFrames were loaded into SQLite, and SQL queries were used to compute:

Top revenue-generating products

Revenue by store and category

Percentage of delayed vs completed orders

Operational performance metrics

This demonstrates practical SQL usage in analytics workflows.

# 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created featuring:

# 🔑 Key KPIs

Total Revenue

Units Sold

% Delayed Orders

High-Risk Inventory Count

# 📈 Visuals

Revenue by Store & Category

Stock Risk Distribution

Operational Status Breakdown

Product-level performance tables

The dashboard enables quick executive-level insights.

# 🧠 Key Insights

A small subset of products contributes to a large share of revenue

Certain stores consistently outperform others

Products below reorder level indicate inventory replenishment risk

Delayed orders highlight operational inefficiencies

# 🚀 Project Outcomes

Demonstrated end-to-end analytics workflow

Combined Python + SQL + Power BI effectively

Delivered business-focused insights, not just visuals

Suitable for Retail, Operations, Business Analyst roles
